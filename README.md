# Employee-Tracker

## Description
This is an app developed in node.js that uses mySQL to mimic the operation of a Content Management System or CMS for short. It allows the user to keep track of all of the employees in a company by giving them roles which all contains data about the employee such as their salary and department. The user can add and update roles for employees while also adding new employees and departments.

## Installation and Operation
In order to run this app, the user must first clone the repo locally and then navigate into the cloned repo. Once in the cloned repo, run `npm install`. The user should have mySQL workbench installed and should open and run the employeeDb.sql file in mySQL workbench before running the app. The next step that the user will need to do is create a creds.js file in their local repo. An example of what this file looks like is supplied in the creds.js.EXAMPLE file. After the previous steps have been completed, then the app can be started using `node employee.js`. Please refer to the video below to see how to operate the app if needed.
